To run the lynxmotion in RVIZ in its current state without a launch file use the following commands:

Run the following command when in the src/assignment4/urdf directory to generate a usbale urdf file after executing the appropriate macros in the file provided
*rosrun xacro xacro lynxmotion.urdf.xacro > lynxmotion.urdf

Since we have not made a launch file for ourselves yet we can use the urdf_tutorial launch file to start the provided urdf model in RVIZ by executing the following command
*roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=/home/viki/catkin_ws/src/assignment4/urdf/lynxmotion.urdf

//Run with assignment4 launch file
roslaunch assignment4 assignment4.launch model:='$(find assignment4)/urdf/lynxmotion.urdf'
//Run with assignment4 xacro file
roslaunch assignment4 assignment4.launch model:='$(find assignment4)/urdf/lynxmotion.urdf.xacro'
//Version 2 - Working on combine left and right gripper
roslaunch assignment4 assignment4.launch model:='$(find assignment4)/urdf/lynxmotion.02.urdf.xacro'
